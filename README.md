🕰️ Time Travel Dashboard

Description:
The Time Travel Dashboard is an interactive web application that allows users to step back in time. When a user selects a date from the past, the system displays:
	•	🎵 Top music hits from that year
	•	🎬 Popular movies from that year
	•	☁️ Weather conditions from that specific day and the same hour as the current time
	•	🗞️ Recent news headlines from that year

This project combines multiple data sources to recreate the atmosphere of a chosen moment in history — letting users experience what life felt like at that time.

Features:
	•	Choose any date from the past
	•	Displays the weather for that exact day and hour
	•	Fetches music, movies, and news from the same year
	•	Real data powered by external APIs


Goal:
To offer users a unique “time capsule” experience — showing what the world sounded, looked, and felt like on any date they choose.
